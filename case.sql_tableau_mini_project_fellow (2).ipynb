You are a new member of the marketing team that was hired based on your data analytic skills. The company is interested in improving business results through more data-driven analysis and decision making. Traditionally the marketing department has launched campaigns to increase sales using qualitative analysis that has focused on previous experience and an understanding of the market. \nGiven your data analytic skills, your manager has asked you to help the marketing team by  gathering insights into the type of customers the company has and the products they buy. You are also asked to review past campaigns and suggest improvements for future marketing campaigns. In addition to gaining a better understanding of the business your analysis should result in specific recommendations on how the company can improve business results.\n\n**Objective:** The goal of this mini project 4 is to practice your SQL skills by querying and aggregating data. Additionally you will use Tableau to create professional data visualizations.\n\n**Analysis / Data Analytics:** For your analysis your team should begin by answering the questions below. However these questions are aimed only to get you started and practice your skills. You should consider further analysis and determine what additional questions will help in both understanding the business and making recommendations to improve the business’s results. ",

It is used for querying and accessing data, performing data cleaning, and analyzing data that is stored in databases. It performs some similar tasks that we have used Excel for but is a more powerful tool when manipulating larger datasets and provides some of the flexibility found in programming languages.\n\nTableau is a professional data visualization software that is widely used in industry. It is a great tool for storytelling with data. Once you are familiar with its functionality you should notice some similarities with Excel which will allow you to quickly get up to speed with the Tableau software. Use Tableau to create your charts similar to those in Excel for presenting your data insights and it can also be used for exploratory data analysis. ",
